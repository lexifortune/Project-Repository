    <u><h1>Project Proposal - Lexi Fortune</h1></u>
    <h3>February 11, 2022</h3>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>
        I would like to create a website centered around sustainable fashion and promoting conscious consumerism, especially within the fashion industry. This is a topic that I have been really interested in lately after learning more about how flawed and inhumane
        the fashion industry is, including low wages for vulnerable workers in third-world countries, the immense amount of waste that is created through the production of clothing, and the loopholes through which fashion brands manipulate to profit off
        of naive and uninformed consumers who are obsessed with buying apparel and looking "fashionable". I want my website to be informative and gain insight into the depths of this controversial industry, but also I would like my website to be a resource
        with which people who want to learn more and change their shopping habits can be better informed and even more inspired to do so.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of my website, as mentioned above, is to both provide information on the problematic nature of the fashion industry and bring awareness to these issues, and also act a a resource for people who want to become more conscious consumers, especially
        when it comes to shopping for clothing. I hope it can be a website that people can turn to for valuable information that will influence their buying decisions, and I also hope that it can be a website that people will be compelled to share with
        others to help spread awareness and make positive influences to start to change their shopping behaviors. In addition, I would like to illustrate that dressing fashionable and looking good is possible in affordable ways that don't just involve
        buying from fast fashion brands.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>
        My target audience would first be consumers who want to make smarter shopping decisions when buying clothing, but additionally I would like to target people who may currently have bad shopping habits and are fast fashion supporters who support controversial
        fashion brands, most likely because of the attraction of the low-price point that is appealing to them. Another target audience of my website would be people, specifically women, who are passionate about fashion and clothing in general, or even
        specifically women who are interested or avid supporters of sustainable and conscious consumerism of clothing. Considering the ages of females who are most concerned about their looks and the aesthetics of their clothing, I would say that my target
        audience would be catered toward more teenage and young adult women, although I want to try to encompass the styles of women of all ages and provide resources and information that is universal to all of them.
    </p>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page?</h2>
    <p>
        I plan on incorporating an informational page that gives more context on the truths about the fashion industry that will include videos, quotes, and pictures that will enhance the overarching theme of my website. I also want to include a pinterest-inspired
        page that has a collage of different outfits and ideas on how to repurpose and wear different types of clothing in a variety of ways. I want to include a page dedicated to showcasing various companies that are spearheading the sustainable fashion
        and conscious consumerist movement, as well as have a page dedicated solely to the wonders of thrift shopping where I can add some of my own thrifty finds and purchases. Furthermore, I want to create a page about rental fashion and the benefits
        of renting clothing and making smarter shopping decisions since a lot of the clothing that people buy they never end up wearing and it either sits in their drawers or ends up being through away. I think it would be cool to have a community-based
        page that allows visitors to the website to share their own outfits and share their stories and ideas with other people to include more of an interactive component to the website so that people, besides me, can inspire others to join in as well.
